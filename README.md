# LLM Fine-tuning Project for Cybersecurity

This project implements fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically for cybersecurity applications. It focuses on collecting and processing security-related data from various sources to create a specialized training dataset for security-focused LLMs.

## Current Features

### Data Collection
- NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) integration
- MITRE ATT&CK framework data collection
- OWASP Top 10 security documentation
- Stack Overflow security-related Q&A

### Data Processing
- Basic text cleaning and formatting
- Question-Answer pair generation
- CSV output format for easy processing

### Model Training
- Support for multiple fine-tuning approaches:
  - Full fine-tuning
  - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
  - QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)
- Experiment tracking with Weights & Biases

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv llm_finetune
source llm_finetune/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
llm_finetune\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Collection
1. Run the data collection script:
```bash
python src/data/collect_data.py
```
This will collect data from all configured sources and save it to `data/raw/security_dataset.csv`

### Data Preprocessing
1. Run the preprocessing script:
```bash
python src/data/preprocess.py
```
This will clean and format the collected data for training.

### Training
1. Configure training parameters in `configs/training_config.yaml`
2. Start training:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

### Evaluation
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

## Future Work

### Data Collection Enhancements
1. Additional Data Sources:
   - Microsoft Security Advisories
   - Cisco Security Advisories
   - SANS Training Materials
   - Security Tool Documentation (Splunk, ELK, Wireshark)
   - Reddit r/netsec community data
   - Security blogs and news sources

2. Data Quality Improvements:
   - Implement rate limiting and retry logic
   - Add data validation and cleaning
   - Enrich data with metadata
   - Support for multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
   - Data deduplication and quality filtering

### Model Training Enhancements
1. Advanced Training Features:
   - Multi-task learning for different security domains
   - Few-shot learning capabilities
   - Domain-specific tokenization
   - Custom loss functions for security tasks

2. Model Architecture:
   - Support for more model architectures
   - Custom attention mechanisms for security context
   - Knowledge distillation from multiple security sources

### Evaluation and Testing
1. Comprehensive Evaluation:
   - Domain-specific evaluation metrics
   - Security-focused benchmark datasets
   - Human evaluation framework
   - Adversarial testing

2. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Unit tests for data processing
   - Integration tests for training pipeline
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Security testing of the model

### Deployment and Integration
1. Model Deployment:
   - API service for model inference
   - Docker containerization
   - Cloud deployment scripts
   - Model versioning and management

2. Integration Features:
   - Security tool plugins
   - IDE integrations
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Monitoring and logging
